# DNS Management System Backend

Welcome to the backend documentation of the DNS Management System. This section outlines the backend architecture, key features, and guidelines for development.

## Features

1. **API Endpoints:**  
   Establish backend API endpoints connecting the UI to the DNS system on AWS Route 53. Implement API calls for CRUD operations on DNS records.

2. **Supported DNS Record Types:**  
   The backend supports various DNS record types, including:
   - A (Address) Record
   - AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record
   - CNAME (Canonical Name) Record
   - MX (Mail Exchange) Record
   - NS (Name Server) Record
   - PTR (Pointer) Record
   - SOA (Start of Authority) Record
   - SRV (Service) Record
   - TXT (Text) Record
   - DNSSEC

3. **Enhancements:**  
   - Integration of filters and search options for efficient data retrieval.
   - Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.
   - Integration with AWS SDK for seamless interaction with Route 53.

## Development Guidelines

- Use Node.js and Express.js for backend development.
- Utilize Prisma for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.
- Ensure robust error handling and validation of incoming requests.
- Implement middleware for authentication and authorization.
- Write comprehensive documentation for API endpoints and their functionality.

## Dependencies

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Prisma:** Modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.
- **AWS SDK for JavaScript:** Client to interact with AWS services, including Route 53.
